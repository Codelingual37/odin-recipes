    <h3>Recipe for Peppered Duck Breast and Red Wine Sauce</h3>
    <p>Recipe thanks to <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12245-peppered-duck-breast-with-red-wine-sauce">NY Times writer David Tanis</a>.</p>
    <p>This recipe by David Tanis is one that I've personally taken from and modified in the past. The red wine sauce really goes well with the peppered duck, adding a rich, savory taste to a duck that would be perfectly fine on its own.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p>For yield of 6 servings</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Muscovy duck breasts (about 1 pound each)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly crushed black peppercorns</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh thyme sprigs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 large shallot, sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 cups unsalted chicken broth</li>
        <li>¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons medium-bodied red wine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Cognac or brandy</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons potato starch</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the tenderloins (the thin strips of meat on undersides of the duck breast) and reserve for the sauce. With a sharp knife, trim away any gristle from the undersides of the breasts and trim any excess fat. Score the skin in a diamond pattern, cutting through the fat but not quite reaching the meat. Lightly sprinkle salt on both sides, then rub 1 teaspoon crushed black peppercorns all over. Sprinkle with the garlic and a few thyme sprigs, cover, and leave at room temperature for 1 hour. (For deeper flavor, refrigerate the breasts for several hours or overnight, then return to room temperature before cooking.)</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon unsalted butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallot and the reserved duck tenderloins; let them brown well, stirring occasionally, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and a small thyme sprig and let them fry for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the broth and ¼ cup wine, raise the heat to a brisk simmer and let the liquid reduce to about 1¼ cups, about 10 minutes. Strain the sauce and return to the heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons red wine and the Cognac or brandy and cook for 1 minute more. Dissolve potato starch in 2 tablespoons cold water, then stir the mixture into the sauce. Whisk in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Season to taste with salt. (Sauce may be made in advance and reheated, thinned with a little broth.)</li>
        <li>Remove and discard the garlic and thyme sprigs from the breasts. Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high. When the pan is hot, lay in the duck breasts, skin-side down, and let them sizzle. Lower the heat to medium and cook for a total of 7 minutes, checking to make sure the skin isn't browning too quickly. With tongs, turn the breasts over and let them cook another 3 minutes for rare, 4 to 5 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer to a warm platter and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice crosswise, not too thickly, at a slight angle and serve with the sauce.</li>
    </ol>
